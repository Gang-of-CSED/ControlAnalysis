# Control Systems Analysis

# 1-Signal Flow Graphs Solver

## **Overview**

---

This project involves developing a software application capable of visualizing and analyzing signal flow graphs. The application will allow users to draw nodes and branch gains of a signal flow graph to provide a graphical representation of the graph, list all forward paths and loops, calculate system determinant Œî and paths determinant Œî1,Œî2..Œîn , and compute the overall system transfer function. by Manon's rule.

    - It provides a detailed system transfer function calculation using Mason's rule.
4. **Flexible Input :**
    - The user can enter the gain of edges as numbers , symbols , letters even negative letters like -H3.

### **Algorithms Implemented**

---

1. **Graph Traversal for Finding All Paths**:
    - **Objective**: Identify all forward paths from an input node to an output node in the signal flow graph.
    - **Method**: Depth-first search (DFS) is used to explore all possible paths from the start node to the end node. As each node is visited, it is marked to prevent revisiting, and the path is recorded. Once the target node is reached, the current path is saved as a forward path.
2. **Cycle Detection for Loops**:
    - **Objective**: Detect all feedback loops within the graph, which are critical for calculating the system‚Äôs transfer function.
    - **Method**: A modified depth-first search is used where each node starts a new DFS to find cycles. A cycle is confirmed if a node is revisited before the DFS completes. Each loop is then stored, ensuring no node in the loop has been touched by other loops' paths.
3. **Detection of Non-Touching Loops**:
    - **Objective**: Identify sets of loops that do not share common nodes, which are used to calculate the determinant of the graph.
    - **Method**: Recursive combinations are formed from the list of detected loops, and for each combination, it is checked whether they are non-touching by ensuring no common nodes are present.
4. **Calculation of Transfer Function Using Mason‚Äôs Gain Formula**:
    - **Objective**: Compute the overall system transfer function.
    - **Method**:
        - The determinant of the system is first calculated using the identified loops and their combinations.
        - For each forward path, the path gain is multiplied by the determinant of the subgraph formed by removing the nodes in the path (using non-touching loops).
        - The transfer function is the sum of these terms divided by the determinant of the entire graph.
5. **Simplification and Output Adjustment**:
    - **Objective**: Output the paths, loops, and transfer function in a readable format.
    - **Method**: Each path and loop is converted into a human-readable string showing nodes and gains. Algebra.js is used to simplify expressions and convert them to strings for display
